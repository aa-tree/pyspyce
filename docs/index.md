# Introduction

This project is a python wrapper for [NAIF's SPICE](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/).

# Installation

Note: These steps will be automated in upcoming version of the install script.


1. Download this repository. Let's say you store it in */path-to-repo/spyce/*

1. Download JPL's SPICELIB (C) from here: [http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit//C/PC_Linux_GCC_64bit/packages/cspice.tar.Z](http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit//C/PC_Linux_GCC_64bit/packages/cspice.tar.Z)

    - Unzip the downloaded file. Let's say you get a folder like */path-to-SPICE-ZIP/cspice*


- Run the script 'config.sh' in the */path-to-repo/spyce/config/* directory providing the location of newly extracted CSPICE folder.

        Example:

        sh config.sh /path-to-SPICE-ZIP/cspice/


- This will create an .so linked library named *cspice.so*. This linked library's location will need to specified while using Spyce's functions.

1. Download the following Binary kernels from JPLâ€™s website. These are data files that store the ephemerides. Use FTP, to make this process simple.

    - [https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/de435.bsp](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/de435.bsp)

    - All files in the folder https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/satellites/

    - Skip the folder a_old_version.
    - Move all these downloaded files to */path-to-repo/spyce/eph/*


1. Download all the files in the folder: [https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/lsk/](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/lsk/)
    - Move these to */path-to-repo/spyce/gkernels*

# Examples

A few example programs can be found in example folder.
