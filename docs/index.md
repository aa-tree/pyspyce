1. Download this repository. Let's say you store it in */path-to-repo/spyce/*

1. Download the following Binary kernels from JPLâ€™s website. These are data files that store the ephemerides. Use FTP, to make this process simple.

    - [https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/de435.bsp](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/de435.bsp)

    - All files in the folder https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/satellites/

    - Skip the folder a_old_version.
    - Move all these downloaded files to */path-to-repo/spyce/eph/*


1. Download all the files in the folder: [https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/lsk/](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/lsk/)
    - Move these to */path-to-repo/spyce/gkernels*

# Examples

A few example programs can be found in example folder.
